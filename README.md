# Spring learning plan

## Spring basics - DI, AOP, IoC

## Spring Boot and REST services

## Employee microservice
   * In the previous worksheet you used Spring Boot for the first time, in a purely-technical way.
It is now time to add some business logic and create a Spring Boot application with a story. Let's
start building a skeleton microservice system which will evolve according to the Spring topics.
We will start with a first microservice.

## Spring Boot starters and autoconfiguration
   * Before we continue in bulding the skeleton microservice system, in this worksheet you will
do another technical exercise to gain deeper understanding on the auto-magic of Spring Boot:
how Spring Boot autoconfiguration works, what's in the Spring Boot Starter POM, how a POJO from
a standart Java library can become a Spring Bean that is managed by the Spring IoC container,
how was Tomcat initialized by Spring Boot, etc.

## Mini microservices architecture skeleton
   * In this worksheet, the goal is to get a first, basic and initial understanding of what 
"microservices arhitecture" means. From that purpose, we will enhance the single microservice 
you have done, with an API Gateway and an additional microservice; and define how they interact 
between them.

## Spring Boot Test
